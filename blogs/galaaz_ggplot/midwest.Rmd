The following is the Ruby code and plot for the above example.  There is a small difference between
the code in the example and the code bellow.  If the example is ran, the plot will appear on the
screen, bellow, we generate an 'svg' image and then include it in this document.  In order to
generate and image, the R.svg device is used.  To generate the plot on the screen, use the R.awt
device, as commented on the code.

```{ruby midwest_rb, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 9.1, fig.height = 9.1}
require 'galaaz'
require 'ggplot'

# load package and data
R.options(scipen: 999)  # turn-off scientific notation like 1e+48
R.theme_set(R.theme_bw)  # pre-set the bw theme.

midwest = ~:midwest

# Scatterplot
gg = midwest.ggplot(E.aes(x: :area, y: :poptotal)) + 
     R.geom_point(E.aes(col: :state, size: :popdensity)) + 
     R.geom_smooth(method: "loess", se: false) + 
     R.xlim(R.c(0, 0.1)) + 
     R.ylim(R.c(0, 500000)) + 
     R.labs(subtitle: "Area Vs Population", 
            y: "Population", 
            x: "Area", 
            title: "Scatterplot", 
            caption: "Source: midwest")

puts gg
```
